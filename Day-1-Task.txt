Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP/1.1
1.Establishes a new connection for each request-response cycle.
2.Every HTTP request and response comes with a set of headers containing metadata
3.Browsers in HTTP/1.1 have a restriction called the 'six connections per domain' limit,
which means only six resources can be loaded concurrently from a single domain.
HTTP/2
1.One of the most significant improvements in HTTP/2 is the introduction of multiplexing.
2.HTTP/2 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm (HPACK) to reduce the size of headers, 
minimizing the overhead associated with each request and response.

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
